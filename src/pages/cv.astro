    I am a 3rd year CS student at VinUni. I am fortunate to work as a research assistant at  <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://sail-research.com/">VinUni Security and Artificial Intelligence Lab</a> for the past 2 years, under the supervision of Prof. Kok-Seng Wong and Prof. Khoa D. Doan. My research lies in the intersection of Adversarial Machine Learning,
    Federated Learning (FL) and Explainable AI (XAI). In addition to my research, I am also passionate about learning Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Models (LLMs). I find the intersection of LLMs and RL particularly fascinating, especially in building intelligent systems that can learn to improve their responses based on feedback from the environment.

      Designed two main projects for the course: Tic Tac Toe and Gomoku AI (<a href="https://github.com/Ducthinh19102003/Artificial-Intelligence-projects/tree/main" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Github</a>). These projects challenge students to implement various AI algorithms capable of outperforming pre-programmed bots. The Gomoku AI bots features four levels of difficulty, ranging from a beginner reflex agent to a master-level AI using the Threat-space search algorithm. Custom test cases were also crafted to rigorously evaluate the decision-making processes of the students' AI agents.
